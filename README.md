# VanillaEnhancements

This is a plugin that replaces my own need of having 2-3 separate plugins doing the same thing.
Instead of me having to wait for other devs to update their plugins this is intended for me and my own hosted server to
be able to upgrade to the latest minecraft version posible.

If you see this and it is a public repository, download with caution, i'm working slowly on this as i'm busy IRL.

### Features

- Teleport commands (go/back/bring)
- Overseer for TPS performance
- Double XP Programmed events (through realistic seasons, if not, needs manual activation).
- Faster minecarts
- Fixed bookshelf for compatibility with other enchantment plugins (such as advanced enchantments).
- Double XP affects skills.
- MongoDB telemetry (login/logout, death position and inventory serialization).
- Other gameplay "improvements".


### Planned Features

- Inventory de-serialization and restoration for player
- Death chests
- Villager capture (kinda like pokemon)

### Requirements

- Minecraft 1.19
- MongoDB
- PaperMC
- As of now, some plugins are required (all those that are integrated, if not the plugin won't boot, i'm already working on a fix for this).

### Side notes

This is a playground for commands on my current server. This plugin is not intended to be published on Spigot/CraftBukkit.
The current list of planned features/planned commands **will** grow, i will keep adding more features as i learn to
handle the API correctly, i have some ideas for more commands/features that will be implemented depending on the
longevity of this project.
